### 0.6.1

2016-05-15 Max Prais <maxp@slidepiper.com>, Yaniv Friedensohn <yanivf@slidepiper.com>

* Removed 'perfect-scrollbar' in favour of overflow-y css styling.
Scrolling functionality is now included in 'Documents and Customers', 'Send Documents', and the 
side navbar.

* Fixed signup functionality - create 'signup.js' to handle signups and remove signup code 
from 'sp-functions.js' for better code architecture.

* Added search functionality to customers and documents lists in 'Documents and Customers' and
'Send Documents'.

* Removed 'Copy All' and 'Send All' buttons in 'Send Documents' final step - replace 
with one 'Copy' and 'Send' button.

* Fixed visitors map responsiveness and resizing problem which caused the map width to exceed 
its container for different viewports.

* Fixed visitors map problem where smaller values were not displayed properly.
 

### 0.6.0

2016-05-03 Max Prais <maxp@slidepiper.com>, Yaniv Friedensohn <yanivf@slidepiper.com>

* Created 2 tests (/jobs/test1 and /jobs/test2) for hiring a developer.

* Created customers management view, including the functionality of adding customers
via a CSV file (Outlook, Gmail (Outlook CSV Format), and our own template), 
manually adding customers, updating, and deleting them.

* Requests for customers or files are now routed either to the 'Documents & Customers' section 
or to the email wizard through a routing emulator.

* Created a wizard to send documents to customers.
Three-part wizard allowing the user to select their customers by email, 
then the documents they would like to send, and then they can either copy a single document file-link,
all documents file links, or 'Send All', which opens the default mail client.
Tested with Gmail and Outlook.

* Created the Sales Analytics dashboard which allows viewing metrics and charts of files per customer.

* Created an email templating mechanism using Apache Java Freemarker which allows the alert and 
report emails to be dynamically created through templates.

* Replaced default user first name from null to Generic, and last name from null to Link.

* Created 'Help' and 'Change Password' modals.

* Heap Analytics and Intercom have been installed.

* Added perfect scrollbar: any elements containing lots of content i.e:
menu, customers and file lists, have internal scrolling capabilities.

* Added sweet alerts: this library adds good UI to any alerts.

* Increased file upload max file size to 100MB.

### 0.4.1

2016-03-17 Yaniv Friedensohn <yanivf@slidepiper.com>

* Created the average pages viewed, top exit page, and users CTA metrics.

* Created the performance column and performance benchmark graph.

* Created the geolocation chart (also called visitors map).

* Enabled tracking of the file viewer CTA buttons click event. When a CTA button is clicked, a 
LICKED_CTA event is sent with the following parameters:
1. The CTA button id attribute value.
2. The CTA button text.
3. The CTA button link.

* Created PrintProperty class to help print multiline strings (mostly SQL queries).


### 0.4.0

2016-02-24 Yaniv Friedensohn <yanivf@slidepiper.com>

* Enabled multiple file upload.

* Enabled a backend validation mechanism which inserts the DB only PDF
files. On the frontend enabled a UI mechanism to show the user only
PDF files by default (though the user can choose any file to upload).

* Enabled support for uploading files with files names written in any
language other than English (UTF-8 support).

* Replaced file hash creation mechanism with a hashids.org
implementation in order to disable the previous mechanism possibility
of creating the same hash, and removing its finite hash possibilities
limit.

* Replaced frontend uploading a file event with a backend, reliable,
and more richer event named FILE_UPLOADED which includes the following
parameters:
1. File hash.
2. File name.
3. File size (in bytes).

* Created a mechanism which auto creates a file link for a default (generic) customer when a file 
has been upload. Also created a feature which enables to download all the generic file links (and 
their respective file names) of a salesman. 

* Replaced the old website with a new one.

* Added the ability to customize the file viewer and add up to 3 responsive CTA buttons.

* Redirected slidepiper.com users to www.slidepiper.com

* Developed an analytics dashboard containing various analytics metrics, charts, and table.

* Added subdomain support so that now file links could be represented as:  
http://<subdomain>.slidepiper.com/view?f=<file-link-hash>


### 0.3.2

2016-01-28 Yaniv Friedensohn <yanivf@slidepiper.com>

* Fixed customers import mechanism.


### 0.3.1

2016-01-20 Yaniv Friedensohn <yanivf@slidepiper.com>

* Updated some of the email composer templates placeholders with their respective available merge
  tags.


### 0.3.0

2016-01-17 Yaniv Friedensohn <yanivf@slidepiper.com>

* Enabled GET method request handling within ManagmentServlet.java for the use of jQuery's
  $.getJSON() method.

* Enabled support for an application domain alias (if set), both for Openshift and locally. 

* Replaced frontend file links hash creation mechanism with a backend hashids.org implementation.  
  Also, instead of creating unique file links hashes every time an email is sent, now a file link
  hash is created only for every new salesman-file-customer relationship.

* Replaced the file viewer's file URL format to <host>/view?f=<file link hash>, e.g.
  http://www.slidepiper.com/view?f=9dg5
  
* Previous file links with a now obsolete file link hash and file viewer URL format are preserved
  and will continue to work correctly.

* Created a merge tag mechanism which enables to place merge tags in the email composer. Merge tags
  will be replaced according to their respective customer values.
  Currently, only file, customer first and last name, and salesman first and last name merge tags
  are supported.

* Replaced Gmail email sending mechanism with Gmail API which reduces the need to send an email
  twice (once via SlidePiper system, and then via the email client), and enables 1-to-many sending
  capabilities (currently limited by us to 50 emails per one send).

* Created DbLayer.setEvent() method and a number of new parameters columns in salesman_events 
  table, which allows for a flexible mechanism for recording events.
  
* Created the SENT_MAIL event which records the following parameters after an email was sent
  (currently supported for Gmail only as we cannot be sure an email was actually sent using the
  mailto mechanism):
    1. Access token.
    2. Salesman email client.
    3. Salesman email address.
    4. Customer email address.
    5. Email subject.
    6. Email body.

* Removed "Original Message" section from the salesman alert and report email. The logic behind
  this action is due to replacing the mechanism which creates unique hashes every time an email is
  sent (see above). Thus, it wouldn't be possible to know which sent email (if any) is related to
  opening the file link.

* Fixed customer name representation in the salesman alert email. (Used the salesman report email
  solution)

* Customer first and last name can now be entered manually or via an import, and are saved
  separately.

* Enlarged the email composer email's body textarea element height.


### 0.2.0

2015-12-23 Yaniv Friedensohn <yanivf@slidepiper.com>

* Removed hard-coding to enable flexible deployment.

* Created sign up form.

* Replaced old chat design with a new one.

* Disabled presentation viewer auto close (though kept closing the event sending mechanism).

* Enabled chat and live pitch for mobile devices, and let the chat open collapsed under a certain
  breakpoint.

* Added favicon to the presentation viewer.

* Changed terms and privacy links design.

* Changed presentation viewer title.


### 0.1.0

* This version represents all of the development made
  up until Yaniv Friedensohn joined the project.
