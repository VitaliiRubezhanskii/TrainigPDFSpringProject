### 0.3.0

2016-01-17 Yaniv Friedensohn <yanivf@slidepiper.com>

* Enabled GET method request handling within ManagmentServlet.java for the use of jQuery's
  $.getJSON() method.

* Enabled support for an application domain alias (if set), both for Openshift and locally. 

* Replaced frontend file links hash creation mechanism with a backend hashids.org implementation.  
  Also, instead of creating unique file links hashes every time an email is sent, now a file link
  hash is created only for every new salesman-file-customer relationship.

* Replaced the file viewer's file URL format to <host>/view?f=<file link hash>, e.g.
  http://www.slidepiper.com/view?f=9dg5
  
* Previous file links with a now obsolete file link hash and file viewer URL format are preserved
  and will continue to work correctly.

* Created a merge tag mechanism which enables to place merge tags in the email composer. Merge tags
  will be replaced according to their respective customer values.
  Currently, only file, customer first and last name, and salesman first and last name merge tags
  are supported.

* Replaced Gmail email sending mechanism with Gmail API which reduces the need to send an email
  twice (once via SlidePiper system, and then via the email client), and enables 1-to-many sending
  capabilities (currently limited by us to 50 emails per one send).

* Created DbLayer.setEvent() method and a number of new parameters columns in salesman_events 
  table, which allows for a flexible mechanism for recording events.
  
* Created the SENT_MAIL event which records the following parameters after an email was sent
  (currently supported for Gmail only as we cannot be sure an email was actually sent using the
  mailto mechanism):
    1. Access token.
    2. Salesman email client.
    3. Salesman email address.
    4. Customer email address.
    5. Email subject.
    6. Email body.

* Removed "Original Message" section from the salesman alert and report email. The logic behind
  this action is due to replacing the mechanism which creates unique hashes every time an email is
  sent (see above). Thus, it wouldn't be possible to know which sent email (if any) is related to
  opening the file link.

* Fixed customer name representation in the salesman alert email. (Used the salesman report email
  solution)

* Customer first and last name can now be entered manually or via an import, and are saved
  separately.

* Enlarged the email composer email's body textarea element height.


### 0.2.0

2015-12-23 Yaniv Friedensohn <yanivf@slidepiper.com>

* Removed hard-coding to enable flexible deployment.

* Created sign up form.

* Replaced old chat design with a new one.

* Disabled presentation viewer auto close (though kept closing the event sending mechanism).

* Enabled chat and live pitch for mobile devices, and let the chat open collapsed under a certain
  breakpoint.

* Added favicon to the presentation viewer.

* Changed terms and privacy links design.

* Changed presentation viewer title.


### 0.1.0

* This version represents all of the development made
  up until Yaniv Friedensohn joined the project.
